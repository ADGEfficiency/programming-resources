There are exceptions to most rules.

A visitor to your site begins by building a map of it in their heads. Because without that internal map, nothing they will ever do on your site will fully make sense to them because it has no context.

Visible context is always preferable to the context that has been shuffled off into a hidey-hole somewhere.

The buyer is quite often wrong. That fact never changes their mind.

Prefer structured communications tools like an in-house blog, a wiki, Basecamp, Notion, or GitHub over unstructured messaging platforms like email or Slack. Your work has structure; so should your communications.

Any field with multiple successful competitors is good news. It means that there is demand, which you can tap in by addressing the problem in your way. In a sector with solid margins, this is an opportunity for design innovation to shine.

Any field where all of the other competitors are free services, outdated desktop apps, open-source communities with no revenue, or wannabe startup cults burning through cash is a lethal minefield covered in a cloud of mustard gas.

Never go up against a free service from a multinational. At least, never directly.

Experience is about becoming opinionated abut tools or approach to building software.

Innovation isn't important.

Interviews don't work.
