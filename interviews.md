[Interviewing is a noisy prediction problem](https://erikbern.com/2018/05/02/interviewing-is-a-noisy-prediction-problem.html)

Highly structured interviews add some signal on top of testing cognitive ability + conscientiousness, but that unstructured interviews are almost useless.

Interviewers perceive of unstructured interviews as the most predictive, and intelligence tests as the least predictive, although the estimated actual effectiveness is actually the opposite

1. Intelligence tests seem to be the strongest predictors of job performance (although possibly offensive, and probably illegal in the US)
2. followed by structured interviews
3. followed by unstructured interviews (which have very little predictive power)

Github profiles = many false negatives (good eng. without github)

Good signals
- many short questions
- code reading - what does this snippet of code do? - quicker than code wrinig
- limit homework to 3-5 hours, pay for them
- system design questions - 'how would you design this feature'

`what would I have to see in order for me to change my mind about this candidate?`

`would by best engineers do well on this test?`
