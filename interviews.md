> Reading probes the most fundamental skills. Reading code is probably 95% of what a developer does as part of their job.

- reading is faster than writing,
- create `predict the output` exercises:
  - candidate reads code, predicts output,
  - code is run, compared with the candidate prediction

- find the bug exercise,
- add a feature exercise,

- ask questions about existing code,
- ask questions about PR / issue text.

- present a working app with bugs, get candidate to fix, then ask them to explain project flow, then extend it,
- a real world data fix script that has been simplified to understand and comment on in 20 minutes. The interviewee is the code reviewer before it gets run in production. It covers things like performance, security, typical syntax mistakes, and working with sensitive data. The best part is actually not the script, but the stories it triggers about past challenges.

- get candidate to bring their own code & explain issues / extensions
