[The care and feeding of software engineers (or, why engineers are grumpy)](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2012/06/12/the-care-and-feeding-of-software-engineers-or-why-engineers-are-grumpy/)

And here’s the real crux of the problem: software engineers aren’t builders. Software engineers are creators. 

Building is what you do when you buy a piece of furniture from Ikea and get it home. The instructions are laid out and if you go step by step, you’ll get that comically small table you wanted. 

Creating is a different process, it’s birthing something without direction or instruction. It’s starting with a blank canvas and painting a masterpiece.

I can't state this enough: Programmers don't burn out on hard work, they burn out on change-with-the-wind directives and not ‘shipping'. 

So how do you deal with these grumpy necessities to your business? Review for a moment the things that drive engineers:

    Being creative
    Solving problems
    People using our work

Software engineers are creative, just like product managers and designers, and so you should work to include them in the creative process.
