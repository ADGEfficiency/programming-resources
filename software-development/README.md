[Building Awesome Developer Tools - Ines Montani, PyCon 2019 India Keynote](https://youtu.be/Ivb4AAuj5JY)

everyone who writes code writes developer tools

programmable & extensible tools over fully integrated - better for devs, cheaper to build, reduces feature requests / features to build

favour being able to iterate over what a function returns than adding keyword args to that function

allow users to pass in a function to extend behaviour

an extensible library is one that provides composable primitives

tips
- callbacks,
- function registries (decoractors),
- single dispatch generic functions,
- entrypoints,
- avoiding IO

Building the wrong product
- product that does not address user business needs
- not doing research on users or businesses
- ignoring feedback, low user value features

Mismanaging backlog
- duplicating work, low value features, delaying bug fixes
- working on too many features simultaneously, imbalance of feature work and bug fixing, delaying testing or critical bug fixing 

Rework
- altering delivered work that should have been done correctly
- no clear definition of done

Unnecessarily complex solutions
- a more complicated solution than necessary
- a missed opportunity to simplify features, user interface, or code
- unnecessary feature complexity from the userâ€™s perspective 
- unnecessary technical complexity
- duplicating code, lack of interaction design reuse, overly complex technical design created up-front

Extraneous cognitive load
- the costs of unneeded expenditure of mental energy
- suffering from technical debt,
- inefficient tools and problematic APIs, libraries, and frameworks 
- unnecessary context switching
- inefficient development flow
- poorly organized code 

Psychological distress
- burdening the team with unhelpful stress
- low team morale
- rush mode
- interpersonal or team conflict 

Waiting/multitasking
- cost of idle time, often hidden by multi-tasking
- slow tests or unreliable tests
- unreliable acceptance environment
- missing information, people, or equipment
- context switching from delayed feedback 

Knowledge loss
- cost of re-acquiring information that the team once knew
- team churn
- knowledge silos 

Ineffective communication
- incomplete, incorrect, misleading, inefficient, or absent communication
- team size too large
- asynchronous communication - distributed teams/stakeholders, opaque processes outside team
- imbalance - dominating the conversation; not listening
- Inefficient meetings (lack of focus; skipping retros; not discussing blockers each day; meetings running over (e.g. long stand-ups))
