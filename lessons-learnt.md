## [7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer](https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/)

Not all experience is created equal
- that’s why mentors are so important, and the team you work with is worth so much more than a couple bucks in your paycheck

Loads of companies and startups have little or no tests. 
- no company has a perfect tech setup.
- being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant.
- good enough is good enough.

Documentation lies sometimes.
- focus on automation over documentation where appropriate. 

Disorganized or messy code isn’t the same as technical debt.
- Having some technical debt is healthy
- If you think your codebase is free of technical debt, there is a good chance you’re over-emphasizing polish instead of delivery. And boy did I do that!

## [An Old Hacker's Tips On Staying Employed](https://madned.substack.com/p/an-old-hackers-tips-on-staying-employed)

### Personal brand

Importance of a personal brand for job security
- can be independent of the success of the projects you work on

If you were a complete pain-in-the-ass to work with, dropped the ball a lot, said things you were going to do but didn’t do them, then good luck.

### Make your boss afraid

Make yourself indispensable

### Make your boss happy

Make your boss successful

### Do it anyway

Sometimes you need to do grunt or non-glamarous work
- just get it done

> We are all constantly measured in the eyes of our employers by what we actually deliver, and those who can find a way to succeed even in the face of adversity will always have an advantage over those who cannot, or do not want to.

### Two and done

So the Two-And-Done rule was born, wherein I will state my case the first time, and if whoever is arguing to the contrary does not agree after hearing my position, I’ll let it go. 

But the next time the opportunity comes up, I will argue my point again. Maybe allowing for a gap of time for people to consider my original point, or maybe allowing me time to refine and rephrase my ideas to be more convincing.

If I fail to get my way after the second time though, I am done.
