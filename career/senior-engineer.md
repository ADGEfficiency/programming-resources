Senior engineer == mature engineer
- seek out constructive criticism of their designs

> the degree to which other people want to work with you is a direct indication on how successful you’ll be in your career as an engineer. Be the engineer that everyone wants to work with.

> Mature engineers do not shy away from making estimates and are always trying to get better at it.

All businesses rely on estimates

> Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with rockstar-on-stage work

> Mature engineers lift the skills and expertise of those around them.

The world’s best engineering feats are executed by teams, not singularly brilliant and lone engineers

> What members of underrepresented groups in tech often need most is opportunity and visibility, not advice.

> Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and decisions.
- that most projects engineers work on exist on an axis of optimality and brittleness, and that whether the problems they are solving are acute or chronic.

They know that they work within a spectrum of ideal and non-ideal, and are OK with that

How people feel about technologies, technical decisions, and technical directions is just as important (if not more) than the facts about the details. Mature engineers know this and adjust accordingly.

The “right tool for the job” maxim also has (sometimes unquantifiable) comfortability as a parameter.
