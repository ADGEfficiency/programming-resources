[Developers mentoring other developers: practices I've seen work well](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/developers-mentoring-other-developers/)

Kickoff:

```
 Background. It's nice to share backgrounds to break the ice and get to know the other person a bit better.
What's in it for me? What are you hoping to gain from this relationship? Where would you like to grow? Ask the other person the same thing. The best mentorships are two-way streets, where both people get something out of it.
Roles. What would you hope to get from the mentor? What would the mentor expect from the mentee?
Topics to cover. What areas are you interested in? Where would you like to grow? Is there something more pressing to discuss?
Cadence. How often should we follow up and when? I've seen most developers catch up once every two weeks for half an hour or and hour, at a time that works for both of them, e.g., sometimes over lunch.
Communication between catch-ups. Would the mentor be open to random pings? What is their schedule like?
Short-term wins. What is an area you'd like to grow in the next month? Let's start with focusing on that.
Evaluating progress. What criteria would help to assess how efficient this mentorship is?
Challenges. It's nice to lay out things that might make this relationship hard. For example, it's okay to share with your to-be-mentor that you have no clue how mentorship works. Or your mentor might share how they have a crazy next month, and they will be swamped.

In between meetings

```
Key things that happened since last time. I like to fill in mentor briefly on key things that happened since last time. I keep this short.
Reflecting on action items / guidance / discussions from last time. If I did something we talked about last time like tried out an approach, read a book, I share the results. This is useful for both of us, and my mentor gets to learn something interesting.
A challenge I'm having, talking through it and brainstorming on an approach to solve it.
A recent success I've had. I describe a situation I thought I handled well and why I thought it went well, asking my mentor to share what she thought of it. Nine out of ten times, I get feedback from a different angle, that make me re-evaluate how I'll handle the situation the next time.
