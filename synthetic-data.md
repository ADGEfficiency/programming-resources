Synthetic data

1. Distillation

- capable model generates data,
- won't make the capable model better,
- but you can make many less capable, but more task specific smaller models from that data.

2. One problem direction easier than the reverse

- easier to introduce bugs than to fix them,
- bugs can be introduced with a `bad` model.

3. Producing text that can be verified easily

- OK model generates much data
- then select good data, keep training on good data
- verification is hard
