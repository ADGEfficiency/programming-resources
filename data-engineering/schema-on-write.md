Schema is the structure of a database, defining the nature of the things contained by a database, the relationships between them, and what information is permitted. Information without schema - implicit or explicit - is entropy.

You can get really philosophical with this concept. 

A star can be considered information organised through the schema of gravity, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the underlying rules of the universe. 

A consciousness observing a probabilistic event can be considered an imposition of schema. 

Your mum cleaning your room can be considered a conversion of entropy to information - enforced through the ultimate database engine: your mum.

## schema-on-read vs schema-on-write for storage retrival

Schema on write:
- on one side, you have a laundry basket that holds all your clothes to be washed, and a wardrobe that holds clean clothes: separated by function, form and the manner in which they are preserved best.

Schema on read:
On the other, you have a room that simply contains clothes, in a mix of washed, unwashed, and perhaps in between. The former is schema-on-write. As you deposit things into the room, you impose structure that best resembles what each item is - you sniff things as you pick them up, in an attempt to deduce the nature of the item you are holding in an attempt to impose structure once again so you can make use of it.

I observe the same thing with my personal library. The things I dump into a playlist or a bookmarks bar without much fanfare lose most of their structure, very quickly losing all ability to be retrieved to my diminishing memory of them.

Without the physical world to impose warning signs like a lack of space or that smell I need to investigate, my digital knapsacks are happy to hold infinitely many items without complaining. They are as good as lost.


## solution = structure as early as possible

- keywords,
- tagging,
- hierarchical 

Not only connective, but restrictive

Should something be stored in it's entirety?

Should I cut it up to best fit the structure?


## reduce the mental load at retrival time

Put more emphasis onto the work done at storage time

To replace work done at retrival time
