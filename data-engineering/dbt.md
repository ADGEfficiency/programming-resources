### How do I load data into my warehouse?

dbt assumes that you already have a copy of your data, in your data warehouse. We recommend you use an off-the-shelf tool like Stitch or Fivetran to get data into your warehouse.

### Can dbt be used to load data?

No, dbt does not extract or load data. It focuses on the transformation step only.
