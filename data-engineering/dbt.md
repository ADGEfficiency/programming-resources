dbt connects to and runs SQL against your database, warehouse, platform, or query engine.

## What makes dbt so powerful?

As a dbt user, your main focus will be on writing models (i.e. select queries) that reflect core business logic – there’s no need to write boilerplate code to create tables and views, or to define the order of execution of your models. Instead, dbt handles turning these models into objects in your warehouse for you.

dbt handles boilerplate code to materialize queries as relations. For each model you create, you can easily configure a materialization.
