## Colmuns / Fields to have in your data

Ensure that all Facts/Events have a business timestamp and an arrival/etl timestamp

## Databases

Normalization
- good in theory (no duplication, less memory, link by foreign keys)
- but not good in practice (require many quieries / joins to get data, slow quieries)


## Structured vs Unstructured

Structured versus unstructured data
- structured = schema


## What is a Data Warehouse?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse

Focus on business analytics

Loads data from many sources (makes copies)

Built using ETL or ELT

Focus on structured data
  Schema clearly defined
  Easy to search and analyze
  Can only handle data with specific schema
  Schema changes will cause a lot of trouble
  Data warehouse


## What is a Data Mart?

Simple data warehouse


## What is a Data Lake?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake

Structured and unstructured data
Fast arrival (e.g. no need to clean up first)
Can handle data from any source
No need to worry about schema, schema changes
Blob or file storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob?)

Combination of analytics platform (like Spark, Python) and a storage platform (S3, Azure Blob etc).

Important properties of data lakes:
- Support for unstructured and semi-structured data.
- Scalability to PetaBytes and higher.
- SQL like interface to interact with the stored data.
- Ability to connect various analytics tools as seamlessly as possible.
- Are generally a combination of decoupled storage and analytics tools.
