Snowflake is a true SaaS offering. More specifically:

    There is no hardware (virtual or physical) to select, install, configure, or manage.

    There is virtually no software to install, configure, or manage.

    Ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and tuning are handled by Snowflake.

Snowflake runs completely on cloud infrastructure. All components of Snowflakeâ€™s service (other than optional command line clients, drivers, and connectors), run in public cloud infrastructures.

Snowflake uses virtual compute instances for its compute needs and a storage service for persistent storage of data. Snowflake cannot be run on private cloud infrastructures (on-premises or hosted).

Snowflake is not a packaged software offering that can be installed by a user. Snowflake manages all aspects of software installation and updates.
