a/b
- don't a/b test (unless it really makes sense)
- costs too much
- world isnt IID
- random variation in small samples
- most results are illusory
- small data -> bayesian

lots of data science is about proving something isn't working
- importance of curiosity, talking to users
- causation versus corrulation

- computers are a sadness, I am the cure
- chose boring technology
- discovering python
- you suck at excel, data driven products now!
- chris stucchio on testing
