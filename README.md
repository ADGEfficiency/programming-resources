# Programming Resources

A collection of programming resources, mainly relevant to the work of a data scientist.

These are my personal notes - you will often find my notes and summaries alongside links to articles.

Some of these notes are also used for teaching programming things:

- [fundamentals/computers.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals/computers.md), 
- [fundamentals/programming.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals/programming.md),
- [bash-and-unix/intro.md](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/bash-and-unix/intro.md),
- [test-driven-development](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/tree/master/test-driven-development).

I maintain similar collections on [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/rl-resources) and [machine learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/ml-resources).


## Music to Listen to While Programming

[Project Audio for GitHub](https://github.audio/) - tracks events happening across GitHub and converts them to music notes.

[Listen to Wikipedia](http://listen.hatnote.com/) - real-time visualization and sonification of Wikipedia activity.

[Monte Carlo Methods](https://easylang.online/apps/tutorial_mcarlo.html)

[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html) - Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.
