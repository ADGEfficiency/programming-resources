# Programming Resources

These are my personal notes on programming things - you will often find my notes and summaries alongside links to articles in the many Markdown files in this repo.  This `README.md` also includes lists of resources that I have found useful.

I maintain similar collections on [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/rl-resources) and [machine learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/ml-resources).


## Teaching Materials

Hidden inside these notes are are the content for a few courses:

- [a course on the fundamentals](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals) of [computing](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals/computers.md) & [programming](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals/programming.md),
- [an introduction to bash and UNIX](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/bash-and-unix/intro.md),
- [a test driven development course](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/tree/master/test-driven-development).

[The Architecture of Open Source Applications](https://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html) - Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.
