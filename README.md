# Programming Resources

These are my personal notes on programming & computing things.

You will often find my notes and summaries alongside links to articles in the many Markdown files in this repo.  This `README.md` also includes lists of resources that I have found useful.

I maintain similar collections on [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/rl-resources) and [machine learning](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/ml-resources).


## Teaching Materials

Hidden inside these notes are are the content for a few courses:

- [fundamentals](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals) of [computing](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals/computers.md) & [programming](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/fundamentals/programming.md),
- [Bash and UNIX](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/bash-and-unix/intro.md),
- [test driven development](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/tree/master/test-driven-development).

Other highlgihts are the [memes](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/tree/master/memes).
