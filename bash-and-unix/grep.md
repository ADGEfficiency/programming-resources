# grep

`grep search_term filename`

some of grep's more common flags:

-c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
-h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
-i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
-l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
-n: print line numbers for matching lines
-v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match

`ps aux | grep mongo`

`grep -rl 'search term' .`

`grep -rl CMA .` to find where CMA class is in a folder
