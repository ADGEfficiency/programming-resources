[Thinking like a Panda: Everything you need to know to use pandas the right way. - Hannah Stepanek - Pycon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObUcgEO4N8w)

Index = columns in the underlying code

Levels = names of the indicies in multi index

Labels = integers that refer to labels -> Multi indexing reduces memory usage

inplace=True = avoids duplication

Outer merge = avoids duplication of data in common

Try not to use apply (like a map)
