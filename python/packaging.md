[A not so unfortunate sharp edge in Pipenv | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34077221)

1. packaging,
2. dependency management, 
3. virtual environments.

[Thoughts on the Python packaging ecosystem | Pradyun Gedam](https://pradyunsg.me/blog/2023/01/21/thoughts-on-python-packaging/)

    The Python packaging ecosystem unintentionally became the type of competitive space that it is today.
    The community needs to make an explicit decision if it should continue operating under the model that led to status quo.
    Pick from N different tools that do N different things is a good model.
    Pick from N ~equivalent choices is a really bad user experience.
    Picking a default doesnâ€™t make other approaches illegal.
    Communication about the Python packaging ecosystem is fragmented, and we should improve that.
