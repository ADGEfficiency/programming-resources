Design is also how things look, and how things look can be important.

[Your users will do what you make easy | Handmade Network](https://c3.handmade.network/blog/p/8208-when_making_things_easy_is_bad)

One does have some responsibility to make things easy that should be used, and hard if they shouldn't be used (often).

If there are two ways to solve a problem in a language: A and B. 

If A is the best way (maintainability, fit with the other language mechanisms etc), then it should always be easier to do, even if it that means deliberately making B harder than it needs to be. 

"Making B easier because it has very low cost for me to implement" is not a neutral act of design, but an implicit endorsement.

The user will look at the programming language and think that what is the easiest thing to do is the best thing to do, and violating that is really letting the users down.
