General issues in forecasting
- backwards looking
- non-stationary
- hard to test a three year forecast (need to wait three years)

Evaluation
- different cost in over vs. underestimation
- error by horizon
- custom error metrics are useful

Deep learning vs traditional
- automatic recover trend, seasonality, autocorrelation
- jointly model related series, new vars (factors) (multivariate)
- hidden relationships in data
- complicated to build, computationally expensive, interpretability

---

Stationarity
- identifying when it is ok to forecast

Univarite
- single data series
- conditional / compound series (only seen if active, only observe when loan defaults etc)

Multivariate (panel)
- multiple related series
- use other variables

Confidence intervals

Data preprocessing
- cleaning, outlier removal (esp if it is noise!)
- smoothing
- stability (automated forecasting) - sensitivity to data input (how the forecast changes with different data)
