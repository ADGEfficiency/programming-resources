[How I run my servers](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/how-i-run-my-servers)

Programs that require a database use SQLite, which means that the entire state of the app is kept in a single file. I have two redundant backup solutions: On a daily basis, a backup is taken via the SQLite .backup command, and saved to Tarsnap. The script to do so is run via cron. 

I also use Litestream to stream a copy of the database to DigitalOcean Spaces storage on a secondly basis, with snapshots taken every 6 hours. This gives me quite a lot of confidence that even in the most disastrous of cases, I'm unlikely to lose a significant amount of data, and if I wanted to be more sure, I could crank up the frequency of the Tarsnap backups.
