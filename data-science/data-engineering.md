Data Janitor 101 - [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/soobrosa/data-janitor-101)

emphasis on data quality

KPIs that matter
- DAU, WAU, MAU, LTV, churn
- cohorts, segments, funnels
- first hour, first day

KPI should show you where the problems are

Actionable

Excel = most used programming environment
- no version control, ugly

business analyst ->  data engineer
- not real time / stream at the start

data engineer = entinty recognition
- ETL, events, data warehouse
- know where your data is leaking
- testing - unit test data

- you will see noise

a/b
- don't a/b test (unless it really makes sense)
- costs too much
- world isnt IID
- random variation in small samples
- most results are illusory
- small data -> bayesian


lots of data science is about proving something isn't working
- importance of curiosity, talking to users
- causation versus corrulation







- computers are a sadness, I am the cure
- chose boring technology
- discovering python
- you suck at excel, data driven products now!
- chris stucchio on testing
