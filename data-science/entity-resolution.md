[An introduction to Entity Resolution - needs and challenges | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-entity-resolution-needs-and-challenges-97fba052dde5/)

Entity Resolution is also known as fuzzy matching, merge purge and data matching. When used in the context of a person, entity resolution is referred to as identity resolution. When a single source of data is involved and the purpose is to remove the duplicate entries, fuzzy matching is termed as record deduplication or deduplication.

Entity resolution can resolve names despite the different representations, misspellings, abbreviations, and typographical errors.
