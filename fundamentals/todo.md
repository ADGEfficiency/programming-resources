## All paradigms remove capability from the programmer

Three align with the three big concerns of architecture: function, separation of components, and data management.

Limits direct transfer of control (ie no `GOTO`)

Allows functional decomposition

### 2 - Object Oriented Programming

Discipline on indirect transfer of control

OOP
- encaspsulation = hiding details in a class (abstraction!)
