> The cool thing about programming is that the principles are useful in real life - Hai (Data Science Retreat - Batch 19)

## Simplicity

> That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simpler can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains - STEVE JOBS

> All problems have easy to understand, simple and wrong answers - RAYMOND HEITTIENGER

> One does not accumulate but eliminate. It is not daily increase but decrease. The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity - BRUCE LEE

KISS = keep it simple stupid
- businesses want simple solutions
- few dependencies
- easy to maintain, debug & put in production

YAGNI = you ain't gonna need it
- don't add features in before you know whether you need it

## Writing code

Who is code for
- readability (it's obvious to a new reader)
- maintainability (low cost in future developer time)
- testability (coverage)

Good design = easy to change
- code should be closed for modification but open to extension

## Refactoring

> Refactor religiously - Jack Diederich

> The best writing is rewriting - E. B. WHITE

- programmer speak for iteration
- cycle of reorganizing and rewriting to improve readability & testability
- repeatedly reorganizing + rewriting
- great programmer spends half his time refactoring

Design is not just making short functions - **the real problem is writing code that mixes unrelated ideas**

Good software = well defined concepts & clear responsibilities

Useful strategies
- design patterns & SOLID for classes
- functional programming for pure functions with no side effects
- model-view-controller to separate storage & UI from business logic

Architecture
- should show the intent of a program
- not the frameworks

Best way to learn = write & study lots of programs

Less code is not always better
- I am now very eager to extend a function's body by a line or two if I can introduce more clarity to the code to help me and my teammates understand it.

Not all experience is created equal
- thatâ€™s why mentors are so important, and the team you work with is worth so much more than a couple bucks in your paycheck

Loads of companies and startups have little or no tests.
- no company has a perfect tech setup

Good enough is good enough

Documentation lies sometimes
- focus on automation over documentation where appropriate.
