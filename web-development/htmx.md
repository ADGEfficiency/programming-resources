[Two Approaches To Decoupling](https://htmx.org/essays/two-approaches-to-decoupling/)

Two different types of decoupling in the context of web applications:

Decoupling at the application level via a generic JSON Data API
Decoupling at the network architecture level via a hypermedia API

---

Coupling is a property of a software system in which two modules or aspects of the system have a high degree of interdependence. Decoupling software is the act of reducing this interdependence between unrelated modules so that they can evolve independently of one another.

The concept of coupling and decoupling is closely (and inversely) related to cohesion. Highly cohesive software has related logic within a module or conceptual boundary, rather than spread out throughout a codebase. (A related concept is our own idea of Locality of Behavior)

And we saw that, despite the tighter application-level coupling found in a hypermedia-based application, it is the hypermedia system that handles changes more gracefully.
