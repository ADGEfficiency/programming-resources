Tree traversal over the DOM

A* search for shortest path

To get started, I recommend the following resources:

- Read up on the hashtable, linked list, tree, graphs, heap, queue, and stack data structures. Play around with how to can use them in your language. 
- GeeksforGeeks has a good overview on these. 
- For coding practice, I'd recommend the HackerRank Data Structures collection.
