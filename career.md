Code interviews
- simple solution
- then more advanced
- time and memory complexity
- test cases
- then harder version (maybe not solvable)

Princton’s Algorithms, [Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2)

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

Machine learning knowledge
- regularization
- boosting in rf
- good classification algo if prediction speed more important than accuracy
- Gaussian mixutre models and k-means (what is the connection)

“So we have this problem…”
In some interviews, I was just told about a project the interviewer is currently working on, and then they would pick my brain on how to solve this

Behavioral Interviews
