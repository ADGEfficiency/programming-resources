The following principles I try to keep in mind when writing documentation.

    The purpose of technical writing is to help users accomplish tasks as quickly and effectively as possible. [#]
    People learn by doing, prefer to be shown and not told.
    Get users to their first success quickly.
    There is more than one type of documentation.
    Keep it simple, write in plain language

Tips

    Know your audience, know your purpose
    Put the most important information first

### Avoid Meta Writing

Avoid writing about the writing, try to keep the active parties as the writer and the reader.

You don’t need to tell the reader what you’re going to tell them. Just tell them.

    Bad: This chapter discusses the factors that cause names to rise and fall in popularity.
    Good: What makes a name rise and fall in popularity?

Don’t refer to sections or paragraphs in the writing.

    Bad: Summarizing the preceding section about…
    Good: In summary, … 

Don’t tell the reader something is extremely complex; likewise don’t tell the reader something is simple. The reader will make up their own mind about a concept being easy or hard.

An exception, you do want state any assumptions, for example around skill level. For example, this tutorial assumes previous programming experience.


### Minimalist Introduction

The four principals of minimalist instruction:

    Choose an action-oriented approach. Users typically want to do things. This principle reflects the user-centric nature of minimalism.
    Anchor the tool in the task domain. A tool is a means to an end. This principle asks designers to select training tasks that are meaningful for the user.
    Support error recognition and recovery. To err is human. There are several ways to increase user competence and comfort levels in handling mistakes.
    Support reading to do, study and locate. Designs must fit as much as possible the diverging needs and propensities of the intended audience. This principle reflects the user-centric nature of minimalism.


### (at least) four types of documentation.

    Tutorials – A tutorial is learning-oriented for newcomers, a directed set of lessons to give the user basic confidence and skills. A tutorial should not assume knowledge or language, but is there to take a beginner who doesn’t know what questions to ask through learning.
    How-to Guides – A how-to guide, or FAQ is goal-oriented, directed by the user. A how-to guide can assume the user has basic knowledge and language, but needs to know how to solve a specific problem.
    Explanation – An explanation or overview document is understanding-oriented providing background or additional detailed context.
    Reference Guides – A reference guide is information-oriented, it is accurate and complete describing the machinery. API documentation is an example of a reference guide.
