[mauricioabreu/golings: rustlings but for golang this time](https://github.com/mauricioabreu/golings/)

## Golings Learnings

Declare and initialize variables:

```go
var x = 5
var int x = 5

// inside a function - but cannot define type
x := 5
```


Constants:

```go
const Pi = 3.14
```

Typing in function definition and return:

```go
import "fmt"

func f(n int) int {
	fmt.Println(n)
	return n * 2
}
```

Printing:

```go
import "fmt"

fmt.Println("print a line")

const n int = 5
fmt.Printf("formatted string, n=%d\n", n)
```

Conditionals:

```go
if condition {
	return a
else if {
    return b
}
} else {
	return b
}
```

Switch:

```go
status := "open"

switch {
case status == "open":
	fmt.Println("status is open")
case status == "closed":
	fmt.Println("status is closed")
}
```

Types:

```go
int
float32
float64
string
```

Arrays - fixed size sequence (can't change size), elements same type:

```go
var colors [3]string
```
