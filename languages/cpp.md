[The Design of C++ , lecture by Bjarne Stroustrup](https://youtu.be/69edOm889V4)

- useful language
- C but better
- zero difference in overead for common subset with C
- C with classes - use classes mainly for typing (program safety), rather than code reuse
- classes are types, that map from concepts
- zero overhead use - only use what you pay for
- C compatibility - don't need to teach how to do for loop
