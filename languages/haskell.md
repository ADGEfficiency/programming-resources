## Why Haskell is interesting?

There are quite a few things about Haskell that make it interesting and unique:

    Haskell has no loops because it doesn’t need them. There is no “for” or “while” in Haskell.
    Haskell has no equivalent of the variables that you’re used to; it doesn’t need them either.
    Haskell is a functional language. In a language like Java or Python, your primary view of the world is an object. In Haskell, your primary view of the world is a function. I like to say that Haskell manipulates functions with the same ease that Perl manipulates strings. In Haskell, it’s commonplace to pass around bits of code. This is a powerful concept.
    Haskell functions are also pure. Every time they’re called with the same arguments, they’ll return the same result. Functions in most languages can return different results each time they’re called. The results may depend on things like a global counter or I/O. Haskell functions also have no side-effects. They won’t stomp over a global variable.
    Haskell is a lazy language. It never performs a computation unless it needs to. This is not just an optimization; it’s a powerful way to view the world. Code that could be infinite loops or consume vast amounts of memory in other languages are simple, everyday tools in Haskell.
    Haskell can be either interpreted or compiled to native machine code. It also interfaces easily with C. You can call C functions from Haskell with a minimum of hassle. Usually, you’ll only need 2 or 3 lines of code to accomplish the call. Haskell also has interfaces to Java, .NET, and Python.
