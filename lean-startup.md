## The Lean Startup

Start up is an experiment
Figure out what customers will pay for
Build - measure - learn

## High level summary

Scientific approach to decision making.  Should this product be built?  Figure out what customers will pay for as quickly as possible.

Minimum viable product
Charge money from the start 
Iterate rapidly
Talk to your early adopters (but don’t do what they say)
Run experiments on customers - validated learning

Build - measure - learn cycle.  Accelerate this feedback loop, learn to pivot or perservere

## Review

Entrepreneurship = form of management

Startup = exists to learn how to build a sustainable business.  Institution designed to create new product under uncertainty.

Don’t get attached to initial vision - customers will want something different.  Need to find a synthesis of vision + what customers want.

Success is solving the customer problem.

Innovation accounting - metrics & milestones - how to prioritise work.  Measure progress using validated learning.  Low volume revenue targets

Validated learning = effort to learn what customers want / empirical data from real customers.  Not about how much stuff you are building, but what you are learning.  

Always an individual that does the purchasing.  See customer problem first hand.  Get outside the building.  All successful sales = breaking down organisations into those who matter

The customer archetype is a guide for product development.  The customer archetype is also a hypothesis that should be tested 

Enterprise product - gain competitive advantage by taking risk on something that competitor doesn’t have yet

On sharing ideas - most companies have heaps of great ideas.  Challenge is on prioritisation of tasks and execution.  This is the opportunity for startups

Optimising one part can undermine the whole

## Lean thinking

Lean manufacturing
- Knowledge and creativity of individuals
- Small batch sizes
- Just in time production
- Accelerating cycle times

Lean thinking on value = anything that provides benefit to the customer

Innovators dilemma = incremental / sustaining innovation vs. breakthroughs / disruptive innovation

Innovation = bottom up, decentralised, unpredictable - but it can be managed.

## Testing

If you cannot fail, you cannot learn - this is the important lesson from the scientific method

Fast cycle testing - systems that increase speed at which tests are built, deployed and analyzed

Developing experimentation systems = responsibility of management 

Hypothesis -> predictions -> experiments

The product can generate accurate data about customers.  Your product is the experiment!  

Better hypothesis -> better testing

Customer behaviour is measurable and changeable

Negative results are useful

Courage to put your assumptions to the test

Test riskiest assumptions first

Hypothesis about what will improve metric, set of experiment to test metric

## Two important assumptions

Value hypothesis - what value to users get.  Is my product creating value

Growth hypothesis - how fast does it spread.  What are the reasons behind growth

A/B testing can show that users don’t care about changes

Metcalfs law - value of network proportional to n^2

## MVP

No one will use your initial buggy product anyway

Shipping sooner avoids waste

Early adopters are more forgiving and offer feedback.  Accept/prefer an 80% solution

When in doubt - simplify the MVP.  Every extra feature is a form of waste.  Remove features that don’t contribute towards learning

Inefficient - invest in automation when to busy bringing on new customers

if you don’t know your customer then you don’t know what quality is.  Low quality can be used to see what customers want 

## Four key questions

1. Do customers recognise they have a problem
2. If there was a solution, would they buy it
3. Would they buy it from us
4. Can we build a solution for that problem

## Build - measure - learn

Data -> **learn** -> ideas -> **build** -> product -> **measure** -> data

Want to minimise total time through this loop

## Learn

Learn where to invest your energy (ideas / product / what to measure)

Learning faster = only way to win (head starts don’t matter).  Time away from customers (ie stealth) is unlikely to provide a head start

One month sprints based on user stories - the feature from the customer POV

## Measure

Track metrics that are critical to growth.  Use cohort analysis, not gross metrics.  The best metrics are actionable metrics

Startups job
1. Measure where at now
2. Experiment to learn how to change important metrics

Begin by testing the initial leap of faith assumptions

Give opportunity to preorder product not yet built

MVP gives baseline numbers

Metrics not changing -> pivot

Three A’s of metrics
1. Actionable - need cause -> effect
2. Accessible - simple reports, cohort based, widespread access
3. Auditable - credible data, spot check customers, data comes directly from master (not intermediate)
