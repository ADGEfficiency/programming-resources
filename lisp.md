Common Lisp Koans is a language learning exercise in the same vein as the ruby koans, python koans and others. It is a port of the prior koans with some modifications to highlight lisp-specific features. Structured as ordered groups of broken unit tests, the project guides the learner progressively through many Common Lisp language features.

Nevertheless, engineering knowledge has usually preceded scientific knowledge and often has remained constant while scientific theories about the engineering materials came and went. "Engineers" were able to create sophisticated fires for cooking and metal working using chimneys and other forms of forced oxygen for centuries while scientists flailed from theory to theory. For example, while advanced fire-based engineering was going on in the 6th century BC in Greece, Anaximenes's theory was that the source or nature of the cosmos was aer (air). Aer was constantly in motion. When aer expanded it became aither (ether: bright fiery air as on a clear day); when it expanded further, it became fire. As aer condensed it became clouds; further condensation led to water, ice, earth, and finally rock. Throughout history there have been various theories of what fire was; nevertheless, the chimneys and other artifacts of working with fire remained constant and working properly.

These skills are the skills of guiding—they are the skills of perfecting the presentation of the finished product. For the mapmaker, the available tools include existing maps, computer-aided design tools, and the talent and skill to know what a map is for and how to create one that serves that purpose for human consumption.

In contrast, the writer has only his or her skills; pens, pencils, computers, and paper; and the language—for simplicity let's say it's English—he or she is writing in. The act of creating a good presentation of a story is the act of writing followed by revision. The writer is guided by the many thousands of writers and stories that have come before, the conventions of the culture, and the extensive reading skills the audience can be expected to have.

The difference between Lisp and Java, as Paul Graham has pointed out, is that Lisp is for working with computational ideas and expression, whereas Java is for expressing completed programs.

The distinction some make between prototyping and software development has vexed me my whole career. I have never seen a version 1.0 of a system that was acceptable. I find that every software group messes with the software up until the very time it's deployed or delivered. At the outset the developers want to get something running as soon as possible—they are interested in leaving things out that are not necessary to the purpose of understanding the internal forces and external reactions affecting what has been built. When prototyping was considered part of the development process, people spoke of prototyping languages or languages good for prototyping as an ideal. Though these times are long past, software developers still need to go through the same steps as prototypers did and for the same reasons, but what these developers are using are delivery languages or languages designed to describe tightly a finished program.

Writing and programming are creative acts, yet we've tried to label programming as engineering (as if engineering weren't creative). Instead of fearing creativity, we need to embrace it.
